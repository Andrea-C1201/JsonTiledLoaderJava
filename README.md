This is a simple library in development.
The final achievement is to read a Tiled Json map and load it, using the readed data for 2D games.
Currently, this repository is only the place where I put the code that I write.
In the future, there will be a decent implementation.

Currently, there isn't any javadoc. Sorry :(
